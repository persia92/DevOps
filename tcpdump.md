# All About tcpdump
### 1. Draw the IP Header with detailed bits.
### 2. What is tcpdump?
tcpdump is a packet-analizing tool for capturing network traffic in command line. It captures TCP, UDP and ICMP based traffic.
### 3. How to get the HTTPS traffic? Share the command!
```sh
tcpdump port 443 
tcpdump -nN port 443 # for -n and -N Will not show Doamin name
tcpdump -nNX port 443 # for -X, show header and data in hex & ASCII
```
### 4. For everything on an interface, what is the command?
```sh
tcpdump -i any # shows packets from all interfaces 
tcpdump -i eth0 # eth0 = interface-name
```
### 5. Write the command to find Traffic by IP.
```sh
tcpdump host 10.0.2.15 # Everything going in and out
```
### 6. Share the filtering by Source and/or Destination?
```sh
tcpdump dst 10.0.2.15 # Packets coming to this IP
tcpdump src 10.0.2.15 # Packets going from this IP
```
### 7. How to find Packets by Network, write the line.
```sh
sudo tcpdump net 10.0.2.0/24  # Packets from this network only
```
### 8. Using packet contents with Hex Output, write the command.
```sh
tcpdump -X net 10.0.2.0/24 
tcpdump host -X 10.0.2.15
```
### 9. To find a specific port traffic, write the command.
```sh
sudo tcpdump port 22
sudo tcpdump dst port 22
```
### 10.Show Traffic of One Protocol command.
```sh
sudo tcpdump tcp
sudo tcpdump tcp port 80 # get tcp packets from specific port
sudo tcpdump icmp
sudo tcpdump -X udp
```
### 11. Write the command showing only IP6 Traffic.
```sh
sudo tcpdump ip6
```
### 12. Write the command for finding Traffic Using Port Ranges.
```sh
sudo tcpdump portrange 8088-8090
```
